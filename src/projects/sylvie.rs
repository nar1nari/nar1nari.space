        The idea for this project came to me out of nowhere in September 2024, while I was stuck at home on sick leave." </p>
        <p>"She started out simple - just a bot that could pull up images, play music in voice chats,
        and handle a few roleplay and admin commands like auto-greetings and language settings.
        But the thing that really made her stand out was the built-in AI."</p>

        <p> "Each server gets its own memory, and Sylvie herself has a bit of personality - even a backstory.
        She's more than just a bot. She feels like a character that grew along with the project." </p>

        that you jerked off into an orphan's liquid soap. That's... That's not right, Adam." </q>
        <p class="comment"> "The funniest shit she ever said xd" </p>

        <p> "I even added Sylvie to our Minecraft SMP server.
        It’s kind of wild, looking back, how something that started as a small side project turned into a companion that people actually interact with every day.
        Seeing friends talk to her like she was one of us… that was the moment I realized Sylvie had grown beyond just lines of code." </p>
