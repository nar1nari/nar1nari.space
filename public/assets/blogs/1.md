Every  project starts with a “Hello, World!”, so here we go again.

I finally made my own personal website. It is written entirely in Rust, no JS or HTML code involved, except Trunk HTML entry and JS wrapper for executing WASM.

Is it overkill? Absolutely. <br/>
Does it make me happy? Also absolutely.

I'm not sure what this blog will be yet. But it's my corner of the web, and that's enough for now.

I would be very grateful if you could leave something on the homepage chat and let me know that someone is visiting this corner of the World Wide Web<img src="/assets/images/hatman.gif" style="width: 1rem;">.
