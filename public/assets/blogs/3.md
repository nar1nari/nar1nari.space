I've completely redesigned the website because the old look was awful for the eyes.

All elements are still in the same places, but now the site feels modern and polished.
For the color scheme, I went with [oxocarbon](https://github.com/nyoom-engineering/oxocarbon.nvim).

I had to remove the chat from the homepage since it didn't fit the new design - but who knows, it might make a comeback in the future.
