If you're seeing this blog post and your browser didn't fully reload the website, it means my conditional deployment system is working.

Sike, if u visited this website before, u may see that it is reloaded completely. When I first set this up, the site did fully reload a few times because I was testing and tweaking the system. Now, everything works much more efficiently.

The main idea is simple: when I add a new blog post, the site doesn't rebuild completely. Only the `assets` folder is copied from the repository to the server.

I designed the workflow to be convenient: I write new posts at home in Obsidian, push them via Git, and GitHub Actions automatically checks what changed. If I edited the site's source code, it triggers a full rebuild and deployment. If I only added new blog posts, only the `assets` folder gets copied.

This approach saves so much time, updating the site quickly without unnecessary rebuilds. Also, after adding blogs, your browser does not load all resources again.

Actually, I made this blog post to test this system. It would be funny if it doesn't work, but we'll hope for the best.
